Fix auto-pause on rate limit when pi-coding-agent exhausts retries. After `session.prompt()` resolves with exhausted retries, all four agent types (executor, triage, merger, reviewer) now detect the error on `session.state.error` and trigger `UsageLimitPauser` to activate global pause. Previously, rate-limit errors that pi-coding-agent handled internally were silently swallowed, causing tasks to be promoted to wrong columns with incomplete work.
